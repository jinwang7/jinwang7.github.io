<blockquote class="blockquote">This article introduces two typical targeting models to identifying ideal customer segmentation. Put the concept aside, they are defined by different underlying assumptions and objectives in marketing practice.
</blockquote>

<p>Before start a new marketing campaign, advertisers need to figure out media budget, targeting audience, ads platform and ads creatives, etc. With all above factors in mind, the advertiser have to understand the likelihood of meeting ROI goal by the campaign. This process usually involves analytics team and data scientist. Sometimes there are historical customer and transaction data for similar marketing campaigns or products in database and sometimes there are not. In both cases, data scientist can build a predictive model to answer two fundamental questions that the advertiser want to know. First, what customer segment should be targeted? Second, what is the expected ROI by the campaign?

<span class="caption text-muted">Targeting: Lookalike Model vs Propensity Model</span>


<p>A best practice approach is illustrated as follows.</p>


<ul>
<li>Step 1: Are quality historical data available?
<p>If answer is Yes: </p>
  Collect all customer profile and historical transaction data for similar products. Pre-process the data and be ready to build a predictive model in step 2.
  Otherwise:
  Need a “prior” estimate based on the practitioner’s domain knowledge and experience or take a Bayesian perspective.


<li>Step 2: Set up your admin ads account on MM
<li>Step 3: Get Client ID and Client Secret from your account manager
<li>Step 4: Produce a campaign report that includes media spend, performance metrics, day, state, and region (DMA)
<li>Step 5: Clean up the data feed and push it to local database
<li>Step 6: Set up daily routine to run the script automatically at 8 am on server
<li>Step 7: There are a few steps towards the end of programmatic marketing journey
</ul>


<p> Except for Step 7, you can learn by doing with the source code I provided on my Github. There are a lot more to cover in #7 and I will continue to introduce how to build a predictive model (e.g. Lookalike Model), score prospective audiences and successfully target them on the MM in the next articles.
